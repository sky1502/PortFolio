  about: [
    "Hi, I'm Gagan, a developer and AI researcher interested in how code can learn, adapt, and make sense of the real world. I like breaking systems just enough to understand how they think.",
    "Most of my work lives at the edge of data and design â€” building intelligent agents, generative models, and web tools that blur the line between automation and creativity.",
    "When I'm not experimenting with architectures or debugging distributed chaos, I'm sketching ideas for products that think with us, not just for us.",
